By applying to University through our program you are applying one time for all scholarships that are applicable to that university (academic merit, international status), and if you are accepted to university you will be given scholarships accordingly without any additional applications given automatically for all the years you study there (tuition cost will be lowered automatically and reduction will be reflected in the lower bill each semester). This can be from 10%-50% off cost of tuition depending on university you choose and academic qualifications.
