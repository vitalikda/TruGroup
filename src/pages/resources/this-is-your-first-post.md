Bachelor of Science – Cybersecurity is new this fall.   I think that you readily know the need for these skills and exposure which can be found on GU’s Web site: http://www.gannon.edu/Academic-Offerings/Engineering-and-Business/Undergraduate/Cybersecurity/



Bachelor of Science – Cyber Engineering is also new this fall.   As with its counterpart  in cybersecurity, cyber engineering is both deeply needed and not widely available.   You can find information on GU’s Web site: http://www.gannon.edu/Academic-Offerings/Engineering-and-Business/Undergraduate/Cybersecurity/
